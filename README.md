# Rollin 

**Rollin** is a challenging maze navigation game where players guide a metallic ball through various levels using device tilt controls. The twist? The controls are reversed — tilt left and the ball moves right, tilt forward and the ball rolls backward. This adds an exciting challenge that requires quick reflexes and strategy to master!

## Features -
- **Nostalgic gameplay**: Navigate a maze with a classic metallic ball.
- **Reverse controls**: A unique twist where left tilts move the ball right, and vice versa.
- **Tilt-based movement**: Fully immersive, intuitive control using your device's tilt sensors.
- **Multiple levels**: Increasing difficulty as you progress through mazes.

## How to Play -
1. Tilt your device to move the ball through the maze.
2. Remember, the controls are reversed:
   - Tilting **left** moves the ball **right**.
   - Tilting **right** moves the ball **left**.
   - The same applies for **forward** and **backward** tilts.
3. Guide the ball to the goal while avoiding traps and dead ends.
4. Complete all levels to become a Rollin’ master!
