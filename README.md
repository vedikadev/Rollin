# Rollin
Rollin is a challenging maze navigation game where players guide a metallic ball through various levels using device tilt controls. The twist? The controls are reversed — tilt left and the ball moves right, tilt forward and the ball rolls backward. This adds an exciting challenge that requires quick reflexes and strategy to master!
